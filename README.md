# Refined GitHub Notifications

Enhances the GitHub Notifications page, making it more productive and less noisy.

[Install on Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/461320-refined-github-notifications)

## Features

> **Note**: It's opinionated to my own workflow.

- Add `target="_blank"` to all notifications (and remove `notification_referrer_id`)
- Refresh the page when going back to the tab, so you get the latest notifications
- Remove bot avatars
- Colorize the notification type (mention, review request, etc.)
- Auto mark notifications as done (remove it from the list), if:
  - The issue/PR is closed/merged, that you have not participating at all
  - The issue/PR is closed/merged, and you already read it
  - PRs created by Renovate, if not participating
  - New commits pushed to PRs
  - *Notifications you have bookmarked will be bypassed
- Make sure only one notification tab is opened
- When going to the issue from the notification, inject a flating button to mark it as done and close the tab.

## Philosophy

- Reduce the number of notifications as much as possible
- Don't track issues/PRs that are closed
- The notifications should always be up to date
